# Choice Structure

- Non-relational databases might be the right choice if:
	- Your application requires super-low latency.
	- Your data are unstructured, or you do not have any relational data.
	- You only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.).
	- You need to store a massive amount of data.
