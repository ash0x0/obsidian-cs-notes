Referred to as “scale-out”, allows you to scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources. 
- Horizontal scaling is desirable for large scale applications due to the limitations of vertical scaling. 
- If a web server is offline, another server in the pool can serve requests. 
- If many users access the server simultaneously and it reaches the server’s load limit, users  experience slower response or fail to connect to the server. [[Load Balancing]] is the best technique to address these problems.
