# Preparation Points

- Example of an interesting technical problem you solved
- Example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame 
- Example of leadership or ownership
- Story about what you should have done differently in a past project
- Piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't like about said language
- Question about the company's product/business
- Question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)
# Common Questions

- Tell me about yourself
	- Consider yourself a character in a story, and structure the story with a beginning, middle, and end. 
	- There should be inflection points, characterization, and easy to understand motivations. 
	- Keep it as short as possible, while preserving color and what makes you interesting. 
	- Try not to be negative. 
	- Frame your story around seeking challenge and wanting to better yourself, rather than rejecting or disliking things. 
- Strengths & Weaknesses
- Challenges faced 
- What’s your story / walk me through your resume / why’d you leave your last job? (these are essentially the same question)
- Why us?
- Tell me about a challenging bug you faced and how you solved it.
- Tell me about an interesting project you worked on.

# Common Points Interviewers Consider

- Metacognition about coding. Do you think about how to code well
- Ownership/leadership. Do you see your work through to completion? Do you fix things that aren't quite right, even if you don't have to?
- Communication. Would chatting with you about a technical problem be useful or painful?
- Are you proud of what you've done? amped about what they're doing? and do you have opinions about languages and workflows?
