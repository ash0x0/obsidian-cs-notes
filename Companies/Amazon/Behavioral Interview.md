# Preparation

## Build Story Bank

For each LP, brainstorm 2-3 moments from your career that show you **lived** or demonstrated that principle, as well as 2-3 moments when you didn't. 

Feel free to be vocally self-critical and don't be afraid to talk about your mistakes.

The are looking for **Data Driven Decision**. Making the answers to provide numbers/metrics to back up the actions and outcomes in the examples is crucial for a successful answer. Without data to back up the answers it will be very difficult for the interviews to assess the measurable successes in the story. Include as much **metrics and data points** to show the outcome

The are looking for examples that have scale, scope and complexity. 

How did you impact customers and your team?
What exactly did you drive and contribute towards?
What was the metric before the situation and after your impact?
**N.B. make sure that every story has a concrete result, e.g. time to market was reduced by 2 weeks, sprint cycle was reduced by 2 hours, £5000 cost saving etc.** 
They are looking for examples where you went above and beyond the norm in order to calibrate the effectiveness for this Leadership Principle. 
Include data point to show the successes.

Prefer stories that are:

- **Recent** (≤ 3 years), **high-impact**, and **data-rich**.
- **Varied**—don’t reuse the same project for multiple principles unless it is truly exceptional.
- **Tension-balanced** (e.g., a “Dive Deep” example that also shows you avoided analysis-paralysis, or a “Think Big” story tempered by “Bias for Action”).

Put each story in STAR-I bullet form. Time yourself telling it in < 2 minutes; trim mercilessly.
## Study Plan

| Day | Focus                                                                        | Deliverable                        |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1   | Read all 16 LP pages + Jassy intro                                           | Flashcards: <br>LP name → key line |
| 2   | Group LPs (Customer, Innovation, Operational Excellence, People)             | Mind-map showing inter-play        |
| 3   | Draft Story Bank (≥ 32 bullets)                                              | STARI template filled              |
| 4   | Rehearse aloud, time & refine                                                | ≤ 2 min per story                  |
| 5   | Take two situational-judgement practice sets                                 | Score & review gaps                |
| 6   | Mock interview with peer/AI; record yourself                                 | Written feedback & metrics         |
| 7   | Polish: tighten metrics, add one failure example, print one-page cheat sheet | Ready for assessment               |
# Evaluation

- Every behavioral interview question is mapped to one or two LPs; Bar Raisers ensure consistency.
- Answers are graded with the **STAR** (Situation-Task-Action-Result) rubric
	- Better to use **STARI**—add **Improvement** (what you’d do better next time)
- Interviewers expect “I”, not “we”, quantifiable impact, and at least one failure story. 
## Pitfalls

1. **Generic stories** – “We fixed a bug” isn’t memorable; quantify impact.
2. **Over-indexing on one LP** – Variety signals breadth.
3. **Skipping ‘Improvement’** – Amazon prizes learning loops.
4. **Saying ‘we’** – Own your contribution.
5. **Ignoring contradictions** – Be ready to explain how you balanced, e.g., Frugality vs. Highest Standards.
