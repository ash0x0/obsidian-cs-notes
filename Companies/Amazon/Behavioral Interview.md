# Preparation

## Build Story Bank

For each LP, brainstorm 2-3 moments from your career that show you _lived_ that principle. Prefer stories that are:

- **Recent** (≤ 3 years), **high-impact**, and **data-rich**.
- **Varied**—don’t reuse the same project for multiple principles unless it is truly exceptional.
- **Tension-balanced** (e.g., a “Dive Deep” example that also shows you avoided analysis-paralysis, or a “Think Big” story tempered by “Bias for Action”). ([About Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/what-do-each-of-amazons-leadership-principles-really-mean "An interviewer dives deep on Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles"))

Put each story in STARI bullet form. Time yourself telling it in < 2 minutes; trim mercilessly.
## Study Plan

| Day | Focus                                                                        | Deliverable                        |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1   | Read all 16 LP pages + Jassy intro                                           | Flashcards: <br>LP name → key line |
| 2   | Group LPs (Customer, Innovation, Operational Excellence, People)             | Mind-map showing inter-play        |
| 3   | Draft Story Bank (≥ 32 bullets)                                              | STARI template filled              |
| 4   | Rehearse aloud, time & refine                                                | ≤ 2 min per story                  |
| 5   | Take two situational-judgement practice sets                                 | Score & review gaps                |
| 6   | Mock interview with peer/AI; record yourself                                 | Written feedback & metrics         |
| 7   | Polish: tighten metrics, add one failure example, print one-page cheat sheet | Ready for assessment               |

# Evaluation

- Every behavioral interview question is mapped to one or two LPs; Bar Raisers ensure consistency.
- Answers are graded with the **STAR** (Situation-Task-Action-Result) rubric
	- Better to use **STARI**—add **Improvement** (what you’d do better next time)
- Interviewers expect “I”, not “we”, quantifiable impact, and at least one failure story. 
## Pitfalls

1. **Generic stories** – “We fixed a bug” isn’t memorable; quantify impact.
2. **Over-indexing on one LP** – Variety signals breadth.
3. **Skipping ‘Improvement’** – Amazon prizes learning loops.
4. **Saying ‘we’** – Own your contribution.
5. **Ignoring contradictions** – Be ready to explain how you balanced, e.g., Frugality vs. Highest Standards.
