**Phone Interview Overview:**

The [phone interview](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fen%2Flanding_pages%2Fphone-interview/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/HGVVaSA324bv8jrytf4V77OxjWk=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fen%2Flanding_pages%2Fphone-interview/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/HGVVaSA324bv8jrytf4V77OxjWk=428") is a 60 minute collaborative conversation with an engineer. It will consist of coding, system design basics and behavioural questions surrounding the Amazon Leadership Principles. The interview will be broken down into 3 parts (the order of these parts may vary, depending on the interviewer):

[**Technical Interview (Pair programming)**](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fen%2Flanding_pages%2Fsoftware-development-topics/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/S1mWzDDKHpqGBeydzFhKUU56cDg=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fen%2Flanding_pages%2Fsoftware-development-topics/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/S1mWzDDKHpqGBeydzFhKUU56cDg=428") 

The first part of the interview will be solving a problem to evaluate your knowledge of Computer Science Fundamentals.  You will be given a **small algorithmic problem to solve** in any language of your choice. The second part is an open-ended question to assess your **system design** knowledge. It is a collaborative interview where you will approach the task with your interviewer. Your interviewer will be judging your approach, so please think out loud and share your thought process as you go. Please also ensure that you ask **clarifying questions** before you start trying to solve the problem. Please watch the following video which is an overview of how to approach the Amazon coding interview : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjZpZ_wcYFg](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv=mjZpZ_wcYFg/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/ubpyTpYyhNJiFOvJWVu6JjwUYTI=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv=mjZpZ_wcYFg/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/ubpyTpYyhNJiFOvJWVu6JjwUYTI=428")

**Preparation:**

i) [**Data Structures & Algorithms**](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fen%2Flanding_pages%2Fp-software-development-topics/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/fCJq5ey2kHKvXs3lvzlyH7qcPbs=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fen%2Flanding_pages%2Fp-software-development-topics/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/fCJq5ey2kHKvXs3lvzlyH7qcPbs=428")  & Problem solving 

One of your technical interview will involve solving a small algorithmic problem in a language of your choice. **Ensure to ask clarifying questions before tackling it.**

A [**live code link**](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Flivecode.amazon.jobs%2F/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/yjkKPQ7mHzGUdAzi-8Ntyqi_lGQ=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Flivecode.amazon.jobs%2F/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/yjkKPQ7mHzGUdAzi-8Ntyqi_lGQ=428") will be provided to you in your interview schedule email. You are expected to find a solution for all cases. You can discuss a brute force solution but only to get familiar with this problem. It would be expected you would discuss the **solution, time and space complexity**. It’s important to explain why the data structures is being used and think out loud when approaching the solution. We’re assessing your approach, so it’s very important to **think out loud** so the interviewer can understand your thought process. 

We recommend brushing up on your Data Structures, there is some great practice material further down this page. Part of solving the problem should involve making trade-offs between data structures, implicitly or explicitly, and part of the problem should involve using the data structure to implement an algorithm. You should also be able to justify your choice of data structure by demonstrating your knowledge of the underlying workings of the data structure. They will be looking at which data structures you choose? For example Sets, Lists, Arrays, Classes,  big-O, design patterns, Queues, Stacks, Hash Tables, and Binary Trees. They are looking at whether you are demonstrating the ability to learn and effectively use a new data structure outside of this list that is considered bar raising.

Part of solving the problem should involve making trade-offs between data structures, implicitly or explicitly, and part of the problem should involve using the data structure

to implement an algorithm.

Make sure you are always communicating the ‘why’ behind every decision so your method is easy to follow.

This an ambiguous question where you will be given a situation where you need to improve the performance of a service/application. You **will need to ask clarifying questions** to understand what is being asked and then it will up to you to describe how to make it highly, available, scalable and performant.

The questions are left open ended so you can describe what areas you are familiar with. You will be asked question around performance and scalability. Any knowledge of dealing with caches or adding hardware would be beneficial.

To assess what other companies might call “cultural fit” at Amazon, we evaluate all candidates against the 16 Leadership Principles. They are our values, such as: Deliver Results, Dive Deep, Insist on High Standards and so forth. These aren’t values that we put on the wall and ignore, they are the way we run the business, how we make decisions, and how we assess our candidates and employees consistently. They are a blueprint of the culture of Amazon.

Our interviews are rooted in behavioural-based questions which ask about past situations or challenges you’ve faced and how you handled them, using [**Leadership Principles**](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fcontent%2Fen%2Four-workplace%2Fleadership-principles/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/M2LRd8WpuZW2-vtduINzOxzWoBs=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.amazon.jobs%2Fcontent%2Fen%2Four-workplace%2Fleadership-principles/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/M2LRd8WpuZW2-vtduINzOxzWoBs=428") to guide the discussion. You will be asked 1 - 3 leadership principles style of questions in your phone screen interview. In order to assess you on this fit, your interviewer will ask you questions surrounding each principle.

For example, for ‘Deliver Results’ you may get a question like: “Tell me about a time when you delivered a project whilst working to a tight deadline”. We’ would encourage you to take some time to look through the Leadership Principles. After you have familiarised yourself with them, try to think about a time in your career **where you’ve demonstrated each principle**, as well as a time when you did not. Remember, we have a vocally self-critical culture and we don’t mind failure at Amazon so don't be afraid to talk about your mistakes!

We are looking for **Data Driven Decision** making in your answers so providing numbers/metrics to back up the actions and outcomes in your example are crucial for a successful answer. Without data to back up your answers it will be very difficult for the interviews to assess the measurable successes in your story. 

Please try to answer these questions using the [**STAR format**](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.thebalancecareers.com%2Fwhat-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/wLmc_taAk4u7a1OtiwtsSMzXywY=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.thebalancecareers.com%2Fwhat-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/wLmc_taAk4u7a1OtiwtsSMzXywY=428") **– Situation, Task, Action, Result** and include as much **metrics and data points** to show the outcome. We are looking for an example that has scale, scope and complexity. For example: How did you impact customers and your team? What exactly did you drive and contribute towards and what was the metric before the situation and after your impact. **N.B. make sure that every story has a concrete result, e.g. time to market was reduced by 2 weeks, sprint cycle was reduced by 2 hours, £5000 cost saving etc.** We are looking for an example where you went above and beyond the norm in order to calibrate the effectiveness for this Leadership Principle.

Although you won’t be asked about all of Leadership Principles during your phone interview, we will go into more depth during the onsite interview, so any preparation you do now won’t go to waste. 

1. **Questions (around 5 minutes)**

The last section will be an opportunity for you to ask questions. Your interviewer will be an engineer from the AWS team, so you can be fairly specific with these questions. I would prepare at least 3 or 4.

There are some really good articles online, so I suggest exploring some blogs and forums from past candidates too. This is an article from a respected tech interviewer at Amazon which could be helpful: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141120061048-6976444-ace-the-coding-interview-every-time](https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2F20141120061048-6976444-ace-the-coding-interview-every-time/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/7sg7WbdRCWf_7OtXyCTIAn9xZrw=428 "https://9n3bwgl2.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2F20141120061048-6976444-ace-the-coding-interview-every-time/1/02010000mn9ikcd6-rpkbbq46-fvi4-i6lh-ugcs-blr20p0d8i80-000000/7sg7WbdRCWf_7OtXyCTIAn9xZrw=428")
