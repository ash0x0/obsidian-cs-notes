Exponential complexity. Can be of any form $O(b^n)$ where $b > 1$.

This most often happens with recursion or instances where one function forks into to. Such as [[Fibonacci Sequence]] with basic recursion. Each time we call the function it creates 2 more calls under that function and the chain continues to cascade.
