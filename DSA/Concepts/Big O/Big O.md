It describes the limiting behavior of a function as the arguments tend toward a value or infinity. i.e. it describes the growth of a function time as it relates to input growth. 
Also called asymptotic notation, asymptotic runtime, or big O time.

In increasing order of complexity these are:
- [[O(1)]]
- [[O(log n)]]
- [[O(n)]]
- [[O(n log n)]]
- [[O(nÂ²)]]
- [[O(n^3)]]
- [[O(2^N)]]
- [[O(N!)]]
- [[O(N^N)]]
- [[O(N^N * N!)]]
