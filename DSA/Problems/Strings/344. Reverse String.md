# Problem

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

# Solution

Look at [[Swapping]] to cover other methods to swap elements other than a temp variable;
## [[Two Pointer]] - [[O(n)]] time - [[O(1)]] space

```cpp
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            char tmp = s[left];
            s[left++] = s[right];
            s[right--] = tmp;
        }
    }
}
```

## [[Recursion]] - [[O(n)]] time - [[O(1)]] space

```cpp
class Solution {
  public void helper(char[] s, int left, int right) {
    if (left >= right) return;
    char tmp = s[left];
    s[left++] = s[right];
    s[right--] = tmp;
    helper(s, left, right);
  }

  public void reverseString(char[] s) {
    helper(s, 0, s.length - 1);
  }
}
```
