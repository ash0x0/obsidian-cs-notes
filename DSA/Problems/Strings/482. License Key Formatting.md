# Problem

You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return _the reformatted license key_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
**Output:** "5F3Z-2E9W"
**Explanation:** The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
**Output:** "2-5G-3J"
**Explanation:** The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, and dashes `'-'`.
- `1 <= k <= 104`

# Solution

## [[Right To Left]] - [[O(n)]] time - [[O(1)]] space

```cpp
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string licenseKeyFormatting(string s, int k) {
        string result = "";
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] != '-') {
                result.push_back(toupper(s[i]));
                count++;
                if (count % k == 0) result.push_back('-');
            }
        }
        if (result.size() > 0 && result.back() == '-') result.pop_back();
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```
## Left to right - [[O(n)]] time - [[O(n)]] space

1.  Initialize:
	- `count` to `0`, which is used to count the number of characters in the current group.
	- `n` to input string length.
	- `ans` to an empty string, which is used to store the final result.
2. Now, iterate on the input string in reverse order:
	- We will skip `'-'` characters from the input string.
	- If the current character is not `'-'`, we include the current character in `ans` string and increment the current group size by incrementing `count` by `1`.
	- If `count` reaches `k`, it means we formed a group of size `k`, thus we can append a `'-'` in `ans` now, and reset `count` to start counting a new group.
3. After we finish traversing on the input string, we should check if the last character inserted wasn't a dash. If we find a dash we need to remove it from `ans` string.
4. Now that we formed all groups in reverse order, thus we need to reverse the `ans` string and then return it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string licenseKeyFormatting(string s, int k) {
        int totalChars = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != '-') {
                totalChars++;
            }
        }
        
        int sizeOfFirstGroup = (totalChars % k);
        if (sizeOfFirstGroup == 0) {
            sizeOfFirstGroup = k;
        }
        
        string ans = "";
        int i = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (count == sizeOfFirstGroup) {
                count = 0;
                break;
            }
            if (s[i] != '-') {
                count++;
                ans.push_back(toupper(s[i]));
            }
            i++;
        }
        /* This case will only appear if the value of k is greater than the total number of alphanumeric characters in string s */
        if (i >= s.length()) {
            return ans;
        }
        
        ans.push_back('-');
        
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (s[i] != '-') {
                /* Whenever count is equal to k, we put a '-' after each group*/
                if (count == k) {
                    ans.push_back('-');
                    count = 0;
                }
                ans.push_back(toupper(s[i]));
                count++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
