One of the simplest and most known encryption techniques. It's a type of [[Substitution Cipher]] in which each letter in are replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

This is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher "Vigenère cipher"), and still has modern application in the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 "ROT13").
