Similar to [[Quick Sort]], this recursively splits arrays or data structures and builds them back in the right order by merging. This is a usually stable sorting approach.

Merge sort is of [[O(n log n)]] time and [[O(n)]] space complexity.
# Methodology

1. Split the data structure in 2 halves
2. Recursively sort the halves
3. Merge the results
